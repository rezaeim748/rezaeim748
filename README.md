# Hi there! 👋 I'm Mohammadreza

I'm a computer engineer student at Amirkabir University (Tehran Polytechnic) with a passion for deep learning. Currently, I'm working on Graph Neural Networks.

## 🌱 Interests

- 🧠 Deep Learning
- 🌐 Graph Neural Networks
- 🖥️ Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- 💻 Coding and Problem Solving

## 📚 Education

- 🎓 Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University
  
## 💼 Current Work

Currently, I'm focused on a project at the university where I am comparing the performance of graph neural networks with and without weight matrices on different tasks. My work involves:

- 🧠 Designing GNN architectures tailored for node classification and link prediction.
- 📊 Utilizing different datasets for training the models.
- ⚖️ Comparison between models with and without weight matrices.
